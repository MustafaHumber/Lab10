# Bootstrap Practice Lab 2

This project is a practice exercise aimed at applying Bootstrap concepts to create a responsive webpage showcasing various Bootstrap components and utilities. The webpage includes a navigation bar, hero section, services section, portfolio section, contact form, and footer, all styled using Bootstrap classes.

## Getting Started

To view the webpage, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Ensure that you have an active internet connection since the webpage relies on Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files hosted via CDN.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure and content of the webpage.
- `style.css`: Custom CSS file for adding additional styling.


## Special Instructions

- No special instructions are needed for testing the webpage. Simply open `index.html` in a web browser.
- Ensure you have an active internet connection for proper loading of Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files via CDN.
